# comfyui-moondream-station
A set of ComfyUI custom nodes that integrate Moondream into ComfyUI, either by the Moondream Cloud API, Moondream Station, or Transformers.
**WARNING: Vibe-coded.** Actual code generated by Claude Opus 4.5.

What's been tested and seems to work:
- Connecting to Moondream Station
- Loading models with Transformers
- Moondream Cloud API
- All inference features besides Point (not properly tested) and Segment (which is half-functional, see below)

What has been tested and does NOT work:
- Nothing right now!!

What has not been tested:
- Loading quantized checkpoints (I see no reason why this Shouldn't work but Transformers is full of surprises as it turns out)

What almost works:
- Segment (currently indistinguishable from Detect, doesn't work at all with multi_object=False)

Features:

- Caption: Generate captions based on an image and a selection switch for verbosity
- Query: Ask questions about images, use the answers in your workflow
- Point: Put points on things with a prompt, use their locations in your workflow (untested, note that you have to get it out of the JSON string somehow still)
- Detect: Create bounding box masks and crops with one node
- Segment: Like Detect, but it generates a segmentation mask (Cloud API only, half-functional)

Installation:

- Don't
