# comfyui-moondream-station
A set of ComfyUI custom nodes that integrate Moondream into ComfyUI, either by the Moondream Cloud API, Moondream Station, or Transformers.
**WARNING: Vibe-coded.** Actual code generated by Claude Opus 4.5.

What's been tested to work:
- Connecting to Moondream Station, loading models with Transformers
- All inference features besides Segment (which isn't available outside of the Cloud API right now)

What has been tested and does NOT work:
- *Inline unloading;* the nodes don't properly integrate with ComfyUI's memory management and will NOT be unloaded as intended right now

What has not been tested:
- Loading quantized checkpoints
- Moondream Cloud API

Features:

- Caption: Generate captions based on an image and a selection switch
- Query: Ask questions about images, use the answers in your workflow
- Point: Put points on things with a prompt, use their locations in your workflow (note that you have to get it out of the JSON string somehow still)
- Detect: Create bounding box masks and crops with one node
- Segment: Like Detect, but it generates a segmentation mask (Cloud API only, untested)
